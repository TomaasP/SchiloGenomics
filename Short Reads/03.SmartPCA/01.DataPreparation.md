Admixed strains identified via admixture were removed from the vcf by using vcftools 

```
vcftools --vcf ../02.Admixture/Suvarum.recode.vcf --remove admixed.txt --recode-INFO-all --non-ref-ac-any 1 --out Suva_NonAdmixed --recode
```
Then, the nonAdmixed vcf was prunned same as the admixture analysis
